# ‚ö° DiaTrack: Simple Diabetes Management App

**Power Learn Project - SDG Project Building**

## üéØ Project Goal & SDG Alignment

This project aims to address **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being** by providing a digital solution for managing chronic diseases.

### Problem Statement
Many individuals managing chronic conditions like Type 2 Diabetes rely on manual paper logbooks or disparate apps, leading to inconsistent tracking and difficulty identifying trends. This lack of clear, consolidated data hinders proactive self-management and effective doctor consultations.

### Solution (Core Value Proposition)
**DiaTrack** is an easy-to-use digital logbook that simplifies the tracking of critical health metrics (blood sugar, diet, and exercise). It generates **visual trends and a simple risk score** to help users proactively manage their condition and share actionable data with their healthcare providers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation Guide

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have the following installed on your machine:
* Node.js (LTS version)
* npm (or yarn)
* MongoDB (or a connection string to a cloud cluster like MongoDB Atlas)

### 2. Backend Setup (`backend/` folder)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with your environment variables (e.g., database connection string, port):
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
    # Other secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET for authentication)
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup (`frontend/` folder)

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the client application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running locally, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
